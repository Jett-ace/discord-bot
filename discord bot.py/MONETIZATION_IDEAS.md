**Sell Mora directly (one-time purchases):**

- 💰 **Value Pack** - $4.99 = 100,000 Mora (20% bonus)
- 💎 **Mega Pack** - $9.99 = 250,000 Mora (50% bonus)

- Whales can spend unlimited
- No ongoing commitment

**Add command:** `gshop` to show available packs

## 3. Cosmetic Items
**Premium visual upgrades (no gameplay advantage):**
- Custom profile cards ($1.99)
- Animated emojis in gprofile ($0.99)
- Name colors in leaderboard ($2.99)
- Custom win messages ($1.99)

## 5. Referral Program
**Give users free Premium for inviting others:**

## 6. Ad-Supported Free Tier
**Optional: Show ads for free users:**
- After every 10 games, show a "sponsored message"

## 7. Tournament Entry Fees
**Host weekly/monthly tournaments:**
- Entry: $5 or 50,000 Mora
- Winner takes 50% of pot
- 2nd place: 30%
- 3rd place: 20%
- You keep entry fees as profit

**Example:** 20 players × $5 = $100 pot → Winner gets $50, you profit $0 (but increases engagement!)
**Better:** 100 players × 5,000 Mora entry = Host with in-game currency, sell currency packs
